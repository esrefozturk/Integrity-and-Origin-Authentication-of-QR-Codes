During recent years QR codes started to be used in many areas including posters, business and personal cards and mobile application links. However it brings a danger with itself, that is no one can be sure if qr code is generated  by who. This report is intented  to make a solution to this problem with origin authentication extension to QR codes.

\section{Introduction}

\IEEEPARstart{Q}{R} code (Quick Response Code) is the trademark for a type of matrix barcode (or two-dimensional barcode) first designed for the automotive industry in Japan. A barcode is a machine-readable optical label that contains information about the item to which it is attached. A QR code uses four standardized encoding modes (numeric, alphanumeric, byte/binary, and kanji) to efficiently store data; extensions may also be used.

A QR code consists of black modules (square dots) arranged in a square grid on a white background, which can be read by an imaging device (such as a camera, scanner, etc.) and processed using Reedâ€“Solomon error correction until the image can be appropriately interpreted. The required data are then extracted from patterns that are present in both horizontal and vertical components of the image.
